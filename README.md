# Module 13 Challenge
# Background
# Let's say you work at an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and you've been tasked with improving the email filtering system for its customers. You've been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants you to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.
# 
# You will be creating two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models you'll create will be a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
# Before You Begin
# Before starting the assignment, be sure to complete the following steps:
# 
# Create a new repository for this project called classification-challenge.
# Clone the new repository to your computer.
# 
# Inside your local Git repository, add the starter file spam_detector.ipynb from your file downloads.
#
# Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.
# Instructions
# Make a prediction as to which model you expect to do better.
#
# This challenge consists of the following subsections:
#
# Split the data into training and testing sets.
# 
# Scale the features.
# 
# Create a logistic regression model.
#
# Create a random forest model.
#
# Evaluate the models.
# How does the models compare to your prediction?
